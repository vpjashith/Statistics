**Statistics**  
Statistics is defined as the study and practice of collecting and analyzing data or it is facts or summaries of data.
  
**Proxy**  
Something that is related to what we want to measure, but isn’t exactly what we want to measure.  
  
There are two main statistics types: Descriptive and Inferential.  
* <p align = "justify">Descriptive statistics usually include things like where the middle of the data is what statisticians call measures of central tendency and measures of how spread out the data are.While descriptive statistics can be great, they only tell us the basics. Inferential statistics allows us to make inferences.  </p>
  
* <p align = "justify">Inferential statistics allow us to make conclusions that extend beyond the data we have in hand.  We ask inferential statistics 
to do all sorts of much more complicated work for us. Inferential statistics let us test an idea or a hypothesis.  </p>

<p align = "justify">If Statistics were a superhero, it’s bat call would be uncertainty, and it’s tagline would be “When you don’t know for sure,
but doing nothing isn’t an option.” Thinking mathematically isn’t just about understanding numbers better. It’s about asking important
questions about the world around us. And letting numbers illuminate those questions.  </p>
  
**Mean**  
The mean or average takes the sum of all the numbers in a data set, and divides by the number of data points. 
The average of a set of data points tells us something about the data as a whole, but it doesn’t tell us about individual data points.  

The mean is good at measuring things that are relatively “normally” distributed. “Normal” means a distribution of data that has roughly 
the same amount of data on either side of the middle, and has its most common values around the middle of the data. Data that are 
istributed normally will have
a symmetrical bell shape. A distribution shows us how often each value occurs in our data set, which is also known as their frequency.  

**Median**  
To give unusually large or small values, also called outliers, less influence on our measure of where the center of our data is, we can use the median.
The median is the middle number if we lined up our data from smallest to largest.

**Mode**  
The word mode comes from the Latin word modus, which means “manner, fashion, or style” and gives us the French expression a la mode, 
meaning fashionable.  

<p align = "justify">Bimodal data is an example of “Multimodal” data which has many values that are similarly common. Usually multimodal data results
from two or more underlying groups all being measured together.When the median and mean are different, a distribution is skewed, which is a way of saying that there are some 
unusually extreme values on one side of our distribution, either large or small in our data set.  </p>
 
<p align = "justify">Range takes the largest number in our data set and subtracts the smallest number in the set to give us the distance 
between these two extremes. The larger the distance, the more “spread out” our data is.The <b>IQR</b> looks at the spread 
of the middle50% of your data.</p>

<p align = "justify">The sample variance would consistently be a *little* smaller than the real variance of the population.
We divide by the number of samples minus 1 in order to get the sample variance to be unbiased or a better 
guess for the population variance. The <b>Standard Deviation</b> is the square root of the variance, which gives back the units. 
You can think of the standard deviation as the average amount we expect a point to differ (or deviate) from the mean.  </p>

There are two main types of data that we might encounter: 
* Categorical
* Quantitative.  

<p align = "justify">Quantitative data are quantities, numbers that have both order and consistent spacing.
Categorical data doesn’t have a meaningful order or consistent spacing.We just have to create 
categories out of our quantitative data first. We do that with a process called “binning”.
Binning takes a quantitative variable and bins it into categories that are either pre-existing
or made up.</p>

**Histogram**  
In histograms, like bar charts, the height of the bars tells us how frequently data in a certain range occur.
The bars are squished together because the data are ‘continuous’ which means the values in one bar flow into the next bar,
there’s no separation like in our categorical bar charts.

**Stem and leaf plot**  
A stem and leaf plot is a cousin of the dotplot. It also gives us information about data 
and their frequencies by stacking objects on top of each other. However, stem and leaf plots use values from
the raw data instead of dots.  

**Correlation**  
Correlation measures the way two variables move together, both the direction and closeness of their movement. 
You may have read articles claim that there’s a positive correlation between exercise and heart health.  
 
<p align = "justify">When we see a non-zero slope also called a regression coefficient it’s a sign that there’s some kind of 
relationship between our two variables.The units of your variables can affect the regression coefficient, 
and can also affect the calculation of our correlation. To get around that, we use the standard deviations to scale 
our correlation so that it is always between -1 and 1. This is our correlation coefficient, r. As you get closer and 
closer to a correlation of 0, the points are more and more spread out around our regression line, and eventually
at 0, there’s no linear relationship at all, it’s just dots. </p>

**Squared correlation coefficient**  
<p align="justify">R^2 is always between 0 and 1, and tells us in decimal form how much of the variance in one variable is predicted by the other. 
In other words, it tells us how well we can predict one variable if we know the other. An R^2 of 1 means you can perfectly predict
one variable from the other since 100% of the variation is in one variable.</p>

**Correlation doesn’t equal causation**  
When one thing (A) is correlated with another (B), there’s a few possible reasons  
* A causes B  
* B causes A  
* There’s a third Variable C that causes both A and B, even though A and B aren’t related  
* Or there’s no relationship at all. it’s just a coincidence. These correlations get called spurious correlations,
and they can be hard to catch.

## Controlled Experiments  

Researchers have started using simulationsto study cancer treatments.To predict the impacts of climate change.
Researchers are using VR to simulate disaster situations. And to help train people how to respond in earthquakes or floods.  

<p align="justify">Experiments try to mimic parallel universes by taking the one universe we do have, and splitting it randomly into groups.
Randomness allows us to claim that before the cappuccino makers were given out, there were no systematic differences between the
groups. Because of random allocation we can avoid <b>Allocation Bias</b>(Alocation to group by scientist) ,and <b>Selection Bias</b>(subject selecting their
own groups.  </p>

<p align="justify">In some situations, Researchers can also force
the number of wealthy people or vegans to be the same in each group using something called a Randomized Block Design,
but randomness usually does a pretty good job. Placebos allow us to control these effects
by “pretending” to treat everyone. Subjects in medical studies are often given sugar pills or saline drips to make it seem
like both groups are being treated. This is why we use control group, a group that get fake treatment. </p>

Types of study
* Blid Study - When subjects don’t know which treatment they’re receiving
  * Single Blind Study - Subjects don’t know what treatment they’re getting but the researchers do
  * Double Blind Study - Neither subjects nor researchers don't know what treatment the subjects are getting.

**Matched-Pairs Experiment**   
<p align="justify">A matched pairs design is a special case of a randomized block design. 
It can be used when the experiment has only two treatment conditions; and subjects can be grouped into pairs,
based on some blocking variable. Then, within each pair, subjects are randomly assigned to different treatments.</p>
